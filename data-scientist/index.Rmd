***

### Be International!

<style>
img.flag{width:75px; vertical-align: text-bottom;}
</style>
<!-- ugly hack: align the text to the flags, rather than the other way round -->
<style>
table.center{margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 60%;}
td.mytd{vertical-align: middle;}
</style>

<table class="center">
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="mytd">Chinese</td>
<td class="mytd"><img src="assets/img/china.gif" class="flag" /></td>
<td class="mytd">German</td>
<td class="mytd"><img src="assets/img/germany.gif" class="flag" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="mytd">Russian</td>
<td class="mytd"><img src="assets/img/russia.gif" class="flag" /></td>
<td class="mytd">Ukranian</td>
<td class="mytd"><img src="assets/img/ukraine.gif" class="flag" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="mytd">Japanese</td>
<td class="mytd"><img src="assets/img/japan.gif" class="flag" /></td>
<td class="mytd">Canadian</td>
<td class="mytd"><img src="assets/img/canada.gif" class="flag" /></td>
</table>

### Recruit Young Talent

- many universities now offer data science specialisations
- train your own analysts 
- neccessity: there aren't many data scientists available! 

***

### Offer a challenge

- analysts want to learn, and apply their knowledge
- analysts dread boring work -- that's what scripts are for
- no platitudes, don't exaggerate, don't lie!


<!--
- these are smart people, who will have a good overview of everything that your company is doing (they're crunching the data!). Don't try to fool them, you'll fail.
